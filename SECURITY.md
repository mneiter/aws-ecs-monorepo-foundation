# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, report them privately via GitHub Security Advisories:

- https://github.com/mneiter/aws-ecs-monorepo-foundation/security/advisories/new

Include as much detail as possible:

- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available)
- Affected versions/branches (if known)
- Any suggested mitigations or patches

## Supported Versions

This repository is a foundation and may evolve quickly. Only the default branch (`main`) is considered supported for security fixes.

## Response Expectations

We aim to acknowledge reports in a reasonable timeframe, but response times may vary based on maintainer availability.
